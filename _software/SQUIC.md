**SQUIC** is an $`\ell_1`$-regularized maximum likelihood method for performant large-scale sparse precision matrix estimation. The code is packaged as the shared library ``libSQUIC``, intended for Linux and Mac OS. It is written in C++ and is parallelized with OpenMP, with Python and R APIs available.

The shared library can be downloaded and used directly, or compiled from source, from think [link](https://www.gitlab.ci.inf.usi.ch/SQUIC/libSQUIC).
