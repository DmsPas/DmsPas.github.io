## Sparse QUadratic Inverse Covariance matrix estimation (SQUIC)

**SQUIC** is an $\ell_1$-regularized maximum likelihood method for performant large-scale sparse precision matrix estimation. The code is packaged as the shared library ``libSQUIC``, intended for Linux and Mac OS. It is written in C++ and is parallelized with OpenMP, with Python and R APIs available.

The shared library can be downloaded and used directly, or compiled from source, from this [link](https://www.gitlab.ci.inf.usi.ch/SQUIC/libSQUIC).



## Spectral clustering for source rocks

Oil-oil and oil-source geochemical correlation is a subject of prime importance to the hydrocarbon exploration community for decades. So far, methods such as k-means, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering (HCA) have been extensively used in chemometrics for such problems. In this work, we present a *direct multiway spectral clustering* approach, which is a *graph based* method that allows the automatic selection of the *optimal number of clusters*.

The MATLAB code can be downloaded and used directly from this [link](https://github.com/DmsPas/Spectral-clustering-of-source-rocks/).
