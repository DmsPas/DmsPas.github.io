I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Universit√† della Svizzera italiana (USI)](https://www.usi.ch/en) in Lugano, Switzerland, working at the [Institute of Computing (CI)](https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/) under the supervision of [Olaf Schenk](https://search.usi.ch/en/people/9a52a2fdb8d3d26ec16fb1569b590909/schenk-olaf). The focus of my research is centered around algorithms for graph learning and combinatorial optimization for graph partitioning and clustering.
