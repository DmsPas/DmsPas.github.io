I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Universit√† della Svizzera italiana (USI)](https://www.usi.ch/en) in Lugano, Switzerland, working at the [Institute of Computing (CI)](https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/) under the supervision of [Olaf Schenk](https://search.usi.ch/en/people/9a52a2fdb8d3d26ec16fb1569b590909/schenk-olaf). The focus of my research is centered around algorithms for graph learning and combinatorial optimization for graph partitioning and clustering. Prior to that, I worked on fluid-structure interaction problems as part of my MSc thesis on [Computational Science](https://www.usi.ch/en/education/master/computational-science) at USI, and studied Physics at the [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.physics.auth.gr/en/).

My work is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) under the project 182673 entitled [*Balanced Graph Partition Refinement Using the Graph p-Laplacian*](https://search.usi.ch/projects/1036/balanced-graph-partition-refinement-using-the-graph-p-laplacian).
